About Guilherme Theis
============================

I am a brazilian born in 1996 in Germany (long story here), I grew up in Blumenau (in the state of Santa Catarina). I've studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Paran√° (UFPR) and in my third year I did an exchange in France for two years, where I obtained a double degree with the ENSERIB-MATMECA/University of Bordeaux (Master's in Electronics Systems, specialized in RF).

I've been messing with different types of programming languages (C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, C#) and once I found out LaTeX I feel in love for any type of typesettings I found. This blog for instance serves as an experimental room for my RST understanding.
