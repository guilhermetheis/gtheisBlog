This is a step-by-step to create an ABlog's based blog using Github Pages as host site. I want to write this because this was not clear for me that have somewhat of a base in programming and RST. I hope this can help others and also remind me how to set up blogs if I need one day. The setup used here is an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with python 3.7 (installed by using Anaconda -- which is great for anyone who is working with data and data analysis as I am working right now). I will explain every installation to obtain the setup I am using. 

The whole propose of this is to be a "dumb proof" material. I've been doing this since I've entered the university with my study notes because I found out that what can sound easy to me sometimes is hard to someone else and vice-versa, thus I try to force myself to write and explain everything in the easiest way possible with maximum of detail possible.
