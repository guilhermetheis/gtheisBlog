About the blog
==============

Hello, my name is Guilherme Theis and I am currently studying Electrical Engineering. I am a lover of RF electronics and everything related to that. I am also an enthusiast of anything related to programming, mostly using python or any high-level language, but I can understand and use low-level programming if required.

I am creating this Blog to try to explain the things I've learn and that I am passionate about. While initally I don't want to be something that is oriented to guide someone that read this blog I would thank anyone who replies to help me to both: understand or correct me in the technical aspect and in the language (englsih).

I hope you have a good read!
